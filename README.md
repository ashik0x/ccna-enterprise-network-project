# Enterprise Network Design & Implementation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a real-world enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network follows a core–access hierarchical architecture and includes VLAN segmentation, dynamic routing, security controls, and a DMZ.

## 🏗️ Network Architecture
- Core–Access hierarchical design
- 1 Core Switch
- 3 Access Switches (HR, IT, Sales)
- Router-on-a-Stick for inter-VLAN routing

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- VLANs & 802.1Q Trunking
- Inter-VLAN Routing
- OSPF (Dynamic Routing)
- DHCP
- NAT (PAT)
- Extended ACLs
- DMZ (Web & DNS Servers)

## 🔐 Security Implementation
- VLAN segmentation for isolation
- Extended ACLs to restrict inter-department traffic
- DMZ to isolate public-facing services

## 🧪 Validation
- End-to-end connectivity testing
- Routing verification
- Security rule validation
